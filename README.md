## Neural Networks for Image Segmentation

Over the next month we will build up our knowledge of neural networks and learn to implement them in image segmentation problems. We will begin by learning the basics of Keras and Tensorflow by trying to classify hand-written digits in the MNIST dataset. Then we will take a step back and see what is happening at the level of an individual neuron. After that we will move onto projects specifically related to image segmentation. 

### Week 00: MNIST 
### Week 01: Perceptropm
### Week 02: TBD
### Week 03: TBD
