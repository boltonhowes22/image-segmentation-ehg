## Introduction on Keras and Tensorflow

Keras and Tensorflow are modules designed for deep learning.

Our exercise for the week is in Week00_MNIST.ipynb. The goal is to change the architecture and hyperparameters of the network to (1) improve the accuracy and (2) solve the overfit problem that exists in the code I gave you. I suggest that you try adding new and different types of layers (convolutional layers might be a good place to start), experiment with dropout layers, and look into mini-batches. Below are some resources that cover basics of neural networks as well as details about Keras/Tensorflow. There are tons of good blogs out there so look around.

Also, I would recommend writing and running your code in Google Colab, it is like a google drive for writing code. It is very similar to Jupyter notebooks. It has a lot of the modules already loaded, so I don't think you will need to go through all the tedious downloads.


### Resources
#### For tensorflow and keras

#### Convolutional Neural Networks

#### This has all the python code for writing a neural network from scratch if you are so inclined. It is probably the most comprehensive of the resources. Definitely read through this
