## Let's start with a single neuron

This week we will take a step back and think about a single neuron. Last week you probably used hundreds of neurons across many layers to build your neural network. This week we are going to massively simplify so we can understand what is happening in each of those hundreds of neurons. 

The assignment will be to program a neural network with just one layer and only one neuron--also known as a perceptron. The goal will be to use this "network" tell the difference between red and blue pixel values. For help, see the resources below!
